# PolkaJ Support & Maintenance

* **Project:** PolkaJ Maintenance

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

We have developed the Java client library for Polkadot, which was done with the help from another Grant by W3F.
At this moment, the library covers most of the critical features required to access Polkadot from a JVM-based app.

The existing project can be found at: https://github.com/emeraldpay/polkaj

Thought the library can be already used, it still lacks many of the possible features. 
We'd like to continue the work on the project, as well as do maintenance and work with the community of Java developers.
Most of the expected work has a loose scope and has a continuous and reactive nature, based on the interactions with the community.

### Ecosystem Fit 

Some projects started to use Polkaj, or researching this topic.
And we receive requests and questions almost every week now.
We believe it's important to continue the work on improving the project, which helps the growths of Polkadot ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

The project implies ongoing work on support, following the current community demand.
It doesn't seem to be feasible to prepare any adequate plan in advance, but rather define directions and priorities.

### Expected work

* Ongoing work with the community
  - Communication with developers, through Github Issues, Gitter, E-Mails and other channels. 
    Helping them to integrate the library and start their projects.
  - Reviewing/accepting external Pull Requests and other contributions.
* Cover/implement the missing APIs, with code and documentation. 
  Prioritized by the current demand.
* Bugfixes.
* Launch a standalone website with docs and guides, open to community contributions.

### Grant proposal

We propose to have an agreement on a continuous work, with monthly payment of $8,000. 
We propose to make it a year-long agreement (i.e. $96,000 in total for the year).
